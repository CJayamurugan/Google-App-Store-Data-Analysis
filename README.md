# Google-App-Store-Data-Analysis

Background
Users download apps for various usage purposes. Given that paid service is usually better at offering pleasant experience, and that free apps are more accesible to everyone, what are the user opinions towards these apps?

More specifically, the following questions are of interest:

How do the app ratings differ between paid and free apps in general?
How are the differences distributed across different app categories?
Are there any categories where the differences are statistically significant?
